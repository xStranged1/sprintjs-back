# SprintJS
### The backend of this project is designed to handle key aspects of a runner's performance and progress. It manages the following core features:
- Sprints: Stores data related to individual running sessions, including time, pace, distance, and other relevant metrics.
- Circuits: Tracks different running routes or circuits, capturing the distance and characteristics of each.
- Distances: Records the total distances covered across different sprints and circuits, helping users monitor their progress over time.
- Users: Handles user accounts and authentication, allowing runners to log in and access their data.
- Personal Records: Stores personal bests, providing users with insights into their top performances and improvements.
### The system is designed to offer a comprehensive view of a runnerâ€™s activity, with the ability to track and compare personal milestones and performance.

#### Made with: ExpressJS + TypeORM
#### Database in Postgresql deployed in render
#### Deployed API REST in railway
